## Getting Started

### Connecting Your Wallet

- Click **Connect Wallet** on the dApp homepage.
- Add the Sepolia network to your MetaMask:
  - Network Name: `Sepolia`
  - RPC URL: `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID`
  - Chain ID: `11155111`
  - Currency Symbol: `ETH`
- Ensure you have some Sepolia ETH for gas fees.

### Buying Your Starter Facility

- Every new player must purchase a starter facility using a small ETH deposit (e.g., `0.001 ETH`).
- The starter facility provides a 2x2 grid and a power generator.
- After purchase, you can claim your free starter miner.

### Claiming Your Free Miner

- After buying your facility, select an available tile on the grid.
- Click **Claim Free Miner** to receive your starter miner.
- The miner will be placed on the selected tile and will start mining $PXL immediately.

---

## Expanding Your Mining Operation

### Buying Additional Miners

- Additional miners are purchased using the $PXL token.
- Select a tile on your grid and click **Buy Miner**.
- Each miner has unique stats: hashrate, power consumption, and price.

### Upgrading Your Facility

- Once your grid is full, you can upgrade your facility to unlock more space and power.
- Upgrades require $PXL and are subject to a cooldown period.

---

## Mining & Rewards

- Mining is automatic once a miner is placed on the grid.
- $PXL rewards accrue in real time and can be claimed at any time by clicking **Claim Rewards**.
- Your mining power and rewards are displayed in the dashboard.

---

## The $PXL Token

- $PXL is an ERC20 token used for buying miners, upgrading facilities, and claiming rewards.
- You can earn $PXL through mining or purchase it on Uniswap.
- Add $PXL to your wallet using the **Add PXL to Wallet** button in the Resource Management section.

---

## Smart Contracts

- **PXLToken** – $PXL token contract
- **MiningRig** – Main game contract (facilities, miners, rewards)
