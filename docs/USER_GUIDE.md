## Welcome to PIXELMINER! üéÆ

PIXELMINER is your gateway to the world of decentralized mining. This guide will help you understand how to start mining PXL tokens, manage your mining rigs, and maximize your rewards.

## Quick Start Guide üöÄ

### 1. Connect Your Wallet
1. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right corner
2. Select your preferred wallet (MetaMask recommended)
3. Ensure you're connected to Base L2 network
4. Add some ETH for gas fees

### 2. Get Your First Mining Rig
1. Navigate to the Mining Room
2. Click "Buy Facility" (costs 0.001 ETH)
3. After purchasing the facility, you'll receive a FREE starter miner:
   - **Starter Miner**: 120 H/s hashrate
   - **Power Consumption**: 12 GW
   - **Placement**: Choose any available tile in your 2x2 grid

### 3. Start Mining
1. Your starter miner will automatically begin mining
2. Watch your PXL rewards accumulate in real-time
3. Claim rewards when ready (24h cooldown between claims)

## Mining Mechanics ‚õèÔ∏è

### Understanding Hashrate and Rewards

#### Starter Miner Details
- **Base Hashrate**: 120 H/s (Hash per second)
- **Power Consumption**: 12 GW
- **Reward Calculation**: 
  ```
  Your Share = (Your Hashrate / Total Network Hashrate) * Current Block Reward
  Daily PXL = Your Share * Blocks Per Day
  ```
  Where:
  - Blocks Per Day = ~43200 (2-second block time)
  - Current Block Reward = Initial Reward / (2 ^ Halvings)

#### Hash Power Calculation
1. **Base Hashrate**: Each miner has a base hashrate
2. **Network Difficulty**: Adjusts automatically based on total network hashrate
3. **Reward Distribution**: Your share = Your hashrate / Total network hashrate
4. **Real-time Updates**: Rewards update every block (approximately every 2 seconds)

### Mining Rigs Comparison

| Rig Type | Base Hashrate | Power Consumption | PXL Cost |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Starter  | 120 H/s       | 12 GW            | FREE     |
| Basic    | 320 H/s       | 18 GW            | 120 PXL  |
| Advanced | 600 H/s       | 22 GW            | 220 PXL  |
| Pro      | 920 H/s       | 30 GW            | 402 PXL  |

### Maximizing Your Mining
1. **Regular Upgrades**
   - Upgrade your rigs when possible
   - Focus on hashrate improvements
   - Balance power consumption

2. **Optimal Timing**
   - Claim rewards during low network activity
   - Monitor network difficulty
   - Plan upgrades during low gas periods

## Staking System üíé

### How Staking Works
1. Lock your PXL tokens in the staking pool
2. Earn additional PXL rewards
3. Higher staking amounts = Better rewards
4. Minimum staking period: 7 days

### Staking Tiers

| Tier    | PXL Required | Daily Reward % |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Bronze  | 1,000 PXL    | 0.5%          |
| Silver  | 5,000 PXL    | 1.0%          |
| Gold    | 20,000 PXL   | 2.0%          |
| Diamond | 50,000 PXL   | 3.0%          |

### Staking Strategies
1. **Compound Staking**
   - Reinvest your staking rewards
