## Welcome to PIXELMINER! üéÆ

PIXELMINER is your gateway to the world of decentralized mining. This guide will help you understand how to start mining PXL tokens, manage your mining rigs, and maximize your rewards.

## Quick Start Guide üöÄ

### 1. Connect Your Wallet
1. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right corner
2. Select your preferred wallet (MetaMask recommended)
3. Ensure you're connected to Base L2 network
4. Add some ETH for gas fees

### 2. Get Your First Mining Rig
1. Navigate to the Mining Room
2. Click "Buy Miner"
3. Choose your first mining rig:
   - **Basic Rig**: 100 PXL (Entry level)
   - **Advanced Rig**: 500 PXL (Better efficiency)
   - **Professional Rig**: 2000 PXL (Maximum output)

### 3. Start Mining
1. Your rig will automatically start mining
2. Watch your PXL rewards accumulate
3. Claim rewards when ready (24h cooldown between claims)

## Mining Mechanics ‚õèÔ∏è

### Understanding Hashrate
- Each rig has a base hashrate
- Higher hashrate = More PXL rewards
- Network difficulty adjusts automatically
- Your share of rewards = Your hashrate / Total network hashrate

### Mining Rigs Comparison

| Rig Type | Base Hashrate | PXL Cost | Daily PXL (Est.) |
|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|
| Basic    | 1 H/s         | 100 PXL  | 10-15 PXL        |
| Advanced | 5 H/s         | 500 PXL  | 50-75 PXL        |
| Pro      | 20 H/s        | 2000 PXL | 200-300 PXL      |

### Maximizing Your Mining
1. **Regular Upgrades**
   - Upgrade your rigs when possible
   - Focus on hashrate improvements
   - Balance power consumption

2. **Optimal Timing**
   - Claim rewards during low network activity
   - Monitor network difficulty
   - Plan upgrades during low gas periods

## Staking System üíé

### How Staking Works
1. Lock your PXL tokens in the staking pool
2. Earn additional PXL rewards
3. Higher staking amounts = Better rewards
4. Minimum staking period: 7 days

### Staking Tiers
