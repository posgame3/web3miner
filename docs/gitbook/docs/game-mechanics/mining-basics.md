# Mining Basics

## Overview
Mining in PixelMiner is the core gameplay mechanic that allows players to earn PXL tokens. This guide will help you understand the basics of mining and how to optimize your mining operation.

## Mining Mechanics

### How Mining Works
- Each miner contributes hashrate to your total mining power
- Higher hashrate = more PXL tokens earned
- Mining rewards are distributed based on your share of the total network hashrate
- Rewards are automatically accumulated and can be claimed at any time

### Mining Rewards
- Initial block reward: 50 PXL per block
- Block time: ~12 seconds
- Rewards are halved every 1,296,000 blocks (~30 days)
- Your share of rewards is proportional to your hashrate

### Power Management
- Each miner requires power to operate
- Exceeding your facility's power capacity reduces mining efficiency
- Balance your hashrate with available power
- Upgrade facilities to increase power capacity

## Getting Started

### First Steps
1. Purchase your initial facility (0.01 ETH)
2. Claim your free starter miner
3. Start earning PXL tokens
4. Monitor your mining efficiency

### Optimization Tips
- Keep track of your power usage
- Upgrade facilities when possible
- Balance miner types for optimal efficiency
- Claim rewards regularly

## Advanced Mining

### Hashrate Optimization
- Different miner types offer different hashrate/power ratios
- Strategic placement of miners in facilities
- Upgrade paths for existing miners
- Power efficiency considerations

### Reward Calculation
Your mining rewards are calculated using the following formula:
```
Your Rewards = (Your Hashrate / Total Network Hashrate) * Block Reward
```

### Halving Events
- Rewards are halved every 1,296,000 blocks
- Plan your mining strategy around halving events
- Consider upgrading before halvings
- Monitor network hashrate changes

## Common Issues

### Mining Problems
- Power capacity exceeded
- Low mining efficiency
- Reward calculation issues
- Network congestion

### Solutions
- Upgrade your facility
- Optimize miner placement
- Check network status
- Monitor gas fees
