- Power Consumption: 1 GW
- Cost: Free (one-time claim)
- Ideal for: Beginners and small operations

### Tier 2 - Gaming PC
- Hashrate: 600 H/s
- Power Consumption: 18 GW
- Cost: 120 PXL
- Ideal for: Growing mining operations

### Tier 3 - Hacking PC
- Hashrate: 920 H/s
- Power Consumption: 22 GW
- Cost: 220 PXL
- Ideal for: Serious miners

### Tier 4 - Master Race
