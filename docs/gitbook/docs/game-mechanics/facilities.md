# Facilities

## Overview
Facilities are the foundation of your mining operation in PixelMiner. They provide power and space for your miners, and can be upgraded to increase efficiency and capacity.

## Facility Types

### Starter Facility
- Power Output: 24 GW
- Max Miners: 4
- Grid Size: 2x2
- Cost: 0.01 ETH

### Level 2 Facility
- Power Output: 72 GW
- Max Miners: 8
- Grid Size: 3x3
- Cost: 1,440 PXL

### Level 3 Facility
- Power Output: 10,000 GW
- Max Miners: 12
- Grid Size: 4x4
- Cost: 10,000 PXL

### Level 4 Facility
- Power Output: 20,000 GW
- Max Miners: 16
- Grid Size: 5x5
- Cost: 20,000 PXL

### Level 5 Facility
- Power Output: 50,000 GW
- Max Miners: 20
- Grid Size: 6x6
- Cost: 50,000 PXL

## Facility Management

### Power Management
- Each facility has a maximum power output
- Miners require power to operate
- Exceeding power capacity reduces mining efficiency
- Monitor power usage regularly

### Grid System
- Facilities use a grid-based system
- Each miner occupies one grid space
- Strategic placement is important
- Consider miner placement for optimal efficiency

### Upgrade System
- 24-hour cooldown between upgrades
- Each upgrade increases:
  - Power output
  - Maximum miners
  - Grid size
- Plan upgrades strategically

## Upgrade Process

### Requirements
- Sufficient PXL tokens
- 24-hour cooldown period
- Available upgrade slot
- Proper power management

### Costs
- Level 2: 1,440 PXL
- Level 3: 10,000 PXL
- Level 4: 20,000 PXL
- Level 5: 50,000 PXL

### Benefits
- Increased power capacity
- More miner slots
- Larger grid size
- Better mining efficiency

## Best Practices

### Planning
- Plan upgrades in advance
- Consider power requirements
- Balance cost vs. benefits
- Monitor cooldown periods

### Optimization
- Efficient miner placement
- Power usage monitoring
- Regular maintenance
- Strategic upgrades

### Common Mistakes
- Upgrading too quickly
- Poor power management
- Inefficient miner placement
- Ignoring cooldown periods

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Power capacity exceeded
- Upgrade cooldown active
- Insufficient PXL tokens
- Grid space limitations

### Solutions
- Monitor power usage
- Plan upgrades ahead
- Save PXL tokens
- Optimize miner placement
