# Tokenomics

## Overview
PixelMiner's tokenomics is designed to ensure long-term sustainability and fair distribution of PXL tokens through mining rewards and referral system.

## Token Distribution

Total Supply: 420,000,000 PXL
Initial Supply: 4,200,000 PXL (1% of total supply)

Initial Distribution:
- 40% - Mining Rewards
- 20% - Team & Development
- 15% - Marketing & Partnerships
- 15% - Liquidity Pool
- 10% - Community & Ecosystem

## Mining System

### Mining Mechanics
Miners increase your hashrate on the PixelMiner network, enabling PXL rewards. Each miner is defined by three key attributes:

1. **Hashrate**: The computational power that the miner contributes to your operation
2. **Energy Usage**: The electrical power needed to operate each miner efficiently
3. **Cost**: The PXL cost to acquire a miner for your facility

Players can buy miners anytime with PXL, as long as they have enough power output in their facility.

### Mining Rewards
- Initial block reward: 50 PXL per block
- Block time: ~12 seconds (Base network)
- Blocks per day: ~7,200
- Daily network emission: ~360,000 PXL
- Monthly network emission: ~10,800,000 PXL
- Yearly network emission: ~131,400,000 PXL

### Halving Schedule
Mining rewards are halved every 1,296,000 blocks (approximately 30 days) to ensure long-term sustainability and controlled token emission:

1. Initial Phase (0-30 days):
   - Base mining rate: 50 PXL per block

2. First Halving (30-60 days):
   - Base mining rate: 25 PXL per block

3. Second Halving (60-90 days):
   - Base mining rate: 12.5 PXL per block

## Economic Model

### Supply Control
- Maximum supply cap of 420,000,000 PXL
- Regular halving events
- Token burning mechanisms
- Controlled emission schedule

### Deflationary Mechanisms
- 75% of miner purchases burned
- 75% of facility upgrades burned
- 2.5% referral fee

## Token Utility

### Current Features
1. **Mining Equipment Purchase**
   - Used to purchase different types of mining equipment
   - Higher-tier equipment requires more PXL tokens

2. **Facility Upgrades**

## Mining Efficiency

### Power Management
- Each facility has a maximum power output
- Miners require power to operate
- Exceeding power capacity reduces mining efficiency
- Upgrade facilities to increase power capacity
- **Important**: There is a 24-hour cooldown period between facility upgrades

### Hashrate Optimization
- Higher hashrate = more mining rewards
- Balance between hashrate and power consumption
- Strategic placement of miners in facilities
- Upgrade paths for existing miners

### Facility Upgrade System
- Each facility level increases power capacity and efficiency
- 24-hour cooldown period between upgrades
- Plan your upgrades strategically
- Consider power requirements of future miners
- Upgrade timing affects overall mining efficiency
