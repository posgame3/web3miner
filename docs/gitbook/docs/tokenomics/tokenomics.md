# Tokenomics

## Token Distribution

Total Supply: 420,000,000 PXL
Initial Supply: 4,200,000 PXL

Initial Distribution:
- 40% - Mining Rewards
- 20% - Team & Development
- 15% - Marketing & Partnerships
- 15% - Liquidity Pool
- 10% - Community & Ecosystem

## Mining System

### Mining Mechanics
Miners increase your hashrate on the PixelMiner network, enabling PXL rewards. Each miner is defined by three key attributes:

1. **Hashrate**: The computational power that the miner contributes to your operation
2. **Energy Usage**: The electrical power needed to operate each miner efficiently
3. **Cost**: The PXL cost to acquire a miner for your facility

Players can buy miners anytime with PXL, as long as they have enough power output in their facility.

### Mining Rewards
Rewards are calculated based on the total hashrate of your mining operation, not fixed token amounts per hour. The more hashrate you have, the more PXL tokens you can mine.

### Halving Schedule
Mining rewards are halved every 6 months to ensure long-term sustainability and controlled token emission:

1. Initial Phase (0-6 months):
   - Base mining rate: 100%
   - Target: Reach 10% of max supply

2. First Halving (6-12 months):
   - Base mining rate: 50%
   - Target: Reach 20% of max supply

3. Second Halving (12-18 months):
   - Base mining rate: 25%
   - Target: Reach 30% of max supply

And so on until reaching the maximum supply of 420,000,000 PXL

## Miner Tiers

## Mining Efficiency

### Power Management
- Each facility has a maximum power output
- Miners require power to operate
- Exceeding power capacity reduces mining efficiency
- Upgrade facilities to increase power capacity

### Hashrate Optimization
- Higher hashrate = more mining rewards
- Balance between hashrate and power consumption
- Strategic placement of miners in facilities
- Upgrade paths for existing miners

## Token Utility

PXL tokens serve multiple purposes within the PixelMiner ecosystem:

1. **Mining Equipment Purchase**
   - Used to purchase different types of mining equipment
   - Higher-tier equipment requires more PXL tokens

2. **Facility Upgrades**
   - Upgrade mining facilities to increase efficiency
   - Unlock additional features and capabilities

3. **Governance**
   - Token holders can participate in protocol governance
   - Vote on important protocol decisions and updates

4. **Staking**
   - Stake PXL tokens to earn additional rewards
   - Participate in network security

## Economic Model

The PixelMiner economic model is designed to ensure:

1. **Long-term Sustainability**
   - Regular halving events control token emission
   - Balanced distribution between mining and other uses
   - Maximum supply cap of 420,000,000 PXL

2. **Fair Distribution**
   - Majority of tokens allocated to mining rewards
   - Equal opportunity for all participants
   - Controlled initial supply of 4,200,000 PXL

3. **Value Accrual**
   - Multiple utility cases for PXL tokens
   - Growing ecosystem increases token demand
   - Mining rewards based on hashrate contribution

4. **Anti-inflationary Measures**
   - Controlled token emission through halving
   - Burning mechanisms for excess tokens
   - Maximum supply limit

## Future Developments
