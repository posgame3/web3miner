## Quick Start Guide üöÄ

### 1. Connect Your Wallet
1. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right corner
2. Select your preferred wallet (MetaMask recommended)
3. Ensure you're connected to Base L2 network
4. Add some ETH for gas fees

### 2. Get Your First Mining Rig

2. Click "Buy Facility" (costs 0.001 ETH)
3. After purchasing the facility, you'll receive a FREE starter miner:
   - **Starter Miner**: 120 H/s hashrate
   - **Power Consumption**: 12 GW
   - **Placement**: Choose any available tile in your 2x2 grid

### 3. Start Mining
1. Your starter miner will automatically begin mining
2. Watch your PXL rewards accumulate in real-time
3. Claim rewards when ready (24h cooldown between claims)

## Mining Mechanics ‚õèÔ∏è

### Understanding Hashrate and Rewards

#### Starter Miner Details
- **Base Hashrate**: 120 H/s (Hash per second)
- **Power Consumption**: 12 GW
- **Reward Calculation**: 
  ```
  Your Share = (Your Hashrate / Total Network Hashrate) * Current Block Reward
  Daily PXL = Your Share * Blocks Per Day
  ```
  Where:
  - Blocks Per Day = ~43200 (2-second block time)
  - Current Block Reward = Initial Reward / (2 ^ Halvings)

#### Hash Power Calculation
1. **Base Hashrate**: Each miner has a base hashrate
2. **Network Difficulty**: Adjusts automatically based on total network hashrate
3. **Reward Distribution**: Your share = Your hashrate / Total network hashrate
4. **Real-time Updates**: Rewards update every block (approximately every 2 seconds)

### Mining Rigs Comparison

| Rig Type | Base Hashrate | Power Consumption | PXL Cost |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Starter  | 120 H/s       | 12 GW            | FREE     |
| Basic    | 320 H/s       | 18 GW            | 120 PXL  |
| Advanced | 600 H/s       | 22 GW            | 220 PXL  |
| Pro      | 920 H/s       | 30 GW            | 402 PXL  |

### Maximizing Your Mining
1. **Regular Upgrades**
   - Upgrade your rigs when possible
