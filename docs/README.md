## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Base L2 network configured in your wallet
- PXL tokens for initial mining setup

### Quick Start
1. Connect your wallet to the PIXELMINER platform
2. Purchase your first mining rig using PXL tokens
3. Start mining and earning rewards
4. Stake your rewards for additional benefits

## Mining Mechanics

### Mining Rigs
- **Basic Rig**: Entry-level mining equipment
- **Advanced Rig**: Enhanced mining capabilities
- **Professional Rig**: Maximum efficiency setup

### Hashrate System
- Each rig contributes to your total network hashrate
- Higher hashrate = More PXL rewards
- Network difficulty adjusts automatically

### Rewards
- Real-time PXL token rewards
- Automatic reward distribution
- Claim mechanism with cooldown periods

## Tokenomics

### PXL Token
- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 PXL
- Initial Price: 0.0001 ETH
- Halving Events: Every 100,000 blocks

### Distribution
- 40% Mining Rewards
- 30% Staking Pool
- 20% Development Fund
- 10% Community Treasury

## Game Features

### Mining Room
- Real-time mining statistics
